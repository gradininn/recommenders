In Part One: Nile Valley Civilization, Browder introduces the reader to the basic concepts and principles of Nile Valley culture, such as the origin and meaning of the term Kemet, the significance of the Nile River, the concept of Maat (truth, justice, righteousness), the role of women and family, the development of writing and literature, the achievements in science and mathematics, the construction and function of pyramids and temples, the symbolism and mythology of the Netcheru (divine forces), and the legacy of ancient Egypt in modern times.
 
In Part Two: The Nile Valley Presence in World History, Browder traces the impact and influence of Nile Valley civilization on other regions and peoples, such as Nubia, Ethiopia, West Africa, Greece, Rome, Europe, Arabia, and Asia. He also examines the causes and effects of the invasions and occupations of Egypt by foreign powers, such as the Hyksos, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Turks, the French, and the British. He also exposes some of the distortions and falsifications of Nile Valley history by European scholars and writers who sought to deny or minimize the African contribution to world civilization.
 
In Part Three: Nile Valley Legacy in America, Browder explores the connection and continuity between Nile Valley civilization and African American culture and history. He discusses topics such as the African presence in America before Columbus, the transatlantic slave trade and its impact on African culture and identity, the role of African Americans in the American Revolution and Civil War, the emergence of African American fraternal organizations and secret societies, the Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts Movement, the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power Movement, and the Afrocentric Movement and its challenges.
