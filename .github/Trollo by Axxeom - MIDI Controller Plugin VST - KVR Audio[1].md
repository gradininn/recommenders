## How to Use Trollo
 
Trollo has a simple and intuitive interface that consists of three main sections: Keymap, Mouse Control, and Presets. Let's take a look at each one of them.
 
### Keymap
 
The Keymap section is where you can assign different functions to each key on your MIDI keyboard. You can choose from four types of functions: Note, CC (MIDI Control Change), PB (Pitch Bend), and AT (Aftertouch). To assign a function to a key, simply click on the key on the virtual keyboard and select the function from the drop-down menu. You can also adjust the value of the function by dragging the slider below the menu. For example, if you want to assign note C4 to the first key on your keyboard, you would click on the key and select Note from the menu. Then you would drag the slider until it shows C4.

Then you would drag the slider until it shows the desired modulation value.
 
You can also clear a function from a key by clicking on it while holding Ctrl. To clear all functions from all keys, click on the Clear button at the bottom of the Keymap section.

The Mouse Control section is where you can use your mouse to control pitch bend, modulation, aftertouch, and other MIDI CC messages. To enable mouse control, click on the Enable button at the top of the section. Then you can move your mouse over the virtual keyboard and see how it affects the parameters. The horizontal position of your mouse controls pitch bend, while the vertical position controls modulation. You can also use your mouse wheel to control aftertouch or any other MIDI CC message that you select from the drop-down menu next to it.
 
You can adjust the range and sensitivity of each parameter by dragging the sliders below them. For example, if you want to increase the pitch bend range from +/- 2
