This bundle consists of five plugins that can help you with mastering, stereo enhancement, and creative effects. Here is a brief overview of each plugin and what they can do for you.
 
## VMS Bundle
 
This is the main plugin that combines all the other plugins in one interface. You can use it as a complete stereo channel strip to manipulate everything in the stereo field. It has three high quality EQs, a mono to stereo processor, a stereo compressor, a realtime FFT analyzer, a realtime stereo vectorscope, a realtime waveform view, an output limiter, and a modulation envelope. You can use the modulation envelope to apply a synced envelope to stereo mix level, mono mix level, and other parameters for creative and experimental results.
