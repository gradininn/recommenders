# Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics by Margaret H. Dunham - A Review
 
Data mining is the process of discovering useful patterns and insights from large and complex data sets. It is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, database systems, and visualization. Data mining can be applied to various domains such as business, science, engineering, medicine, and social sciences.
 
One of the books that provides a comprehensive introduction to data mining is Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics by Margaret H. Dunham[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. This book covers both the basic and advanced topics of data mining, such as data preprocessing, classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, spatial mining, temporal mining, and data mining products. The book also presents the key algorithms and techniques used in data mining with pseudocode and examples. The book is suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn more about data mining and its applications.

The book is organized into four parts: core topics, advanced topics, case studies, and appendix. The core topics cover the fundamental concepts and methods of data mining, such as data warehousing, OLAP, multidimensional data, data preprocessing, classification, clustering, and association rules. The advanced topics cover some of the emerging and challenging areas of data mining, such as web mining, spatial mining, temporal mining, and data mining products. The case studies illustrate how data mining can be applied to real-world problems in different domains, such as retailing, banking, fraud detection, web usage analysis, and bioinformatics. The appendix provides a reference on how to use prototypes and data mining products.
 
The book has several features that make it a valuable resource for learning data mining. First, it provides a clear and concise explanation of the concepts and techniques with examples and figures. Second, it offers a balanced coverage of both the theoretical and practical aspects of data mining. Third, it includes unique chapters on web mining, spatial mining, temporal mining, and data mining products that are not commonly found in other books. Fourth, it provides clearly written algorithms in pseudocode that can be easily implemented in any programming language. Fifth, it includes case studies that demonstrate how data mining can solve real-world problems.
 
In conclusion, Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics by Margaret H. Dunham is a comprehensive and accessible book that covers both the basic and advanced topics of data mining. It is a useful reference for anyone who wants to learn more about data mining and its applications.
