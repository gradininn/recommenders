Bilvashtakam is a Sanskrit hymn composed by Sri Adi Shankaracharya in praise of Lord Shiva. It extols the virtues of offering a bilva leaf (also known as vilva or bael) to Shiva during his worship. Bilva leaf is considered sacred and auspicious by Hindus as it represents the three aspects of Shiva: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. It also symbolizes the three eyes, three weapons and three syllables of Shiva.
