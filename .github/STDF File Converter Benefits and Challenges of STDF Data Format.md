STDF (Standard Test Data Format) is a widely used file format for semiconductor test information. It is produced by automatic test equipment (ATE) platforms from various companies, such as LTX-Credence, Roos Instruments, Teradyne, Advantest, and others[^3^]. STDF files contain valuable data about the performance and quality of semiconductor devices, but they are not easy to read or analyze by humans or other software tools. Therefore, converting STDF files to other formats, such as CSV, Excel, or JMP, can be very useful for data analysis and reporting purposes.

There are different tools and methods available for converting STDF files to other formats. In this article, we will introduce some of them and compare their features and limitations.
 
## STDF Viewer
 
STDF Viewer is a free, fast and powerful GUI tool to visualize and analyze STDF data files. It is developed by Noon Chen and can be downloaded from GitHub[^1^]. STDF Viewer supports files under STDF V4 and V4-2007 Specification, as well as ZIP\*, GZ and BZIP compressed STDF files. It can open multiple STDF files and compare them in a single plot. It can also merge STDF files into a single file or multiple groups.
 
STDF Viewer can display various information about the STDF files, such as test summary, bin summary, DUT summary, GDRs and DTRs. It can also generate different types of plots to analyze the test data, such as trend chart, histogram, bin distribution, and wafer map. Moreover, it can generate an Excel report that contains all the information and plots from the STDF files.
 
To convert STDF files to other formats using STDF Viewer, you can use the Converter utility that is included in the tool. The Converter utility can convert STDF files to CSV or Excel xlsx formats. You can select which type of data you want to include in the output file: parametric, bin summary or test summary. You can also specify the delimiter and encoding for the CSV file.
 
## QuickChange Utilities: STDF Converter
 
QuickChange Utilities: STDF Converter is a flexible batch STDF converter that can read one or more STDF files and generate CSV, Excel xlsx or JMP JSL data from the files. It is developed by Spry Software and can be purchased from their website[^2^]. QuickChange Utilities: STDF Converter can handle ZIP\*, GZ and BZIP compressed STDF files as well.
 
The output file can contain parametric, bin summary or test summary data from the STDF files. You can also customize the output format by specifying the column names, order and format for each type of data. You can also filter out unwanted data by using regular expressions or logical expressions.

To convert STDF files to other formats using QuickChange Utilities: STDF Converter, you need to run a command line tool with some parameters. The tool requires Java 1.8 or newer to run. You can use the provided examples (converter.bash or converter.bat) to get started with the conversion process.
 
## Parse::STDF
 
Parse::STDF is a Perl module for parsing files in Standard Test Data Format (STDF). It is developed by Diab Jerius and can be installed from CPAN[^3^]. Parse::STDF can read uncompressed or compressed (gzip or bzip2) STDF files. It can also write uncompressed STDF files.
 
Parse::STDF provides an object-oriented interface to access the records and fields in an STDF file. It also provides some methods to manipulate the records and fields, such as adding, deleting, modifying or filtering them. Parse::STDF does not provide any built-in functionality to convert STDF files to other formats, but it allows you to write your own scripts or programs to do so.
 
To convert STDF files to other formats using Parse::STDF, you need to write some Perl code that uses the module's methods and functions. You also need to have some knowledge of Perl programming and STDF specification. You can find some examples of using Parse::STDF on its documentation page.
