## New Features and Improvements
 
Some of the new features and improvements in Bentley AECOsim Building Designer V8i 08.11.09.376 (x86 x64) are:
 
- Resolved issues that have been requested via the Service Ticket Manager
- The AECOsim Building Designer installer has been updated to allow previously installed versions to be updated versus requiring them to be uninstalled first.
- MicroStation Building Designer - A new application shortcut has been added that enables AECOsim Building Designer to open in "MicroStation Mode". This "MicroStation Mode" defaults to the standard MicroStation interface, and does not include any of the Building discipline capabilities, however it does contain support for Family and Part symbology and Unification, maintaining drawing fidelity in "MicroStation Mode". This allows users the option to retain their MicroStation Ss1 or Ss2 application and the associated Ss1 Building applications, while offering them the capabilities of MicroStation Ss3 through AECOsim Building Designer Ss3.
- Wall Area Center (Gross) & Wall Area Center (Net) have been added for quantification
- Dynamic Views: Detail Views and Detail Drawing Seeds have been updated. Detail Views can reference either a 2d or 3d source. AECOsim Building Designer Drawing Seeds are defined as 2D detail views as the default workflow. Building attributes for Dynamic Views are now available within the Saved View properties
- Structural: Support for ISM 3.0, which provides support for additive and subtractive features such as: web stiffener plates, beam web openings, etc. ISM 3.0 also provides for data transfer of member end reactions for structural framing plans. The CIS/2 translator now provides support for CIS/2 managed data items. Improvement to the âModify Structural Attributesâ command, to allow explicit modifications to be applied to multiple elements. Command acts as an explicit âChange Structural Attributesâ. Accessible via key-in âSTFMODIFY ATTRIBUTES CLASSICâ
- Mechanical: The addition of approximately 100 new components added for HVAC, Fire Protection, Plumbing and Drainage Disciplines (Please consult the readme and Help documentation for a complete list) New AHU Configuration Utility works with all newly created Air Handling Units to allow user to edit parametric values of units
