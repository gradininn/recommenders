# How to Collaborate on Revit Projects Using BIM 360 Design
 
Revit is a powerful software for building information modeling (BIM) that allows architects, engineers, and contractors to design, analyze, and document buildings. However, working on complex projects with multiple team members can be challenging without a reliable and efficient collaboration platform.

That's where BIM 360 Design comes in. BIM 360 Design is a cloud-based service that enables Revit users to collaborate on Revit models in real time, share data across disciplines, and streamline workflows. BIM 360 Design replaces the previous Collaboration for Revit (C4R) service that was available for Revit 2018 and earlier versions.
 
In this article, we will show you how to set up and use BIM 360 Design for your Revit 2019 projects.
 
## Step 1: Subscribe to BIM 360 Design
 
To use BIM 360 Design, you need to have a subscription to the service. You can purchase a subscription from the Autodesk website or from an authorized reseller. The subscription price is CA$1,230 /year (Suggested retail prices, excluding tax.)[^1^].
 
Once you have a subscription, you can access BIM 360 Design from your Autodesk Account. You will also need to install the BIM 360 Design add-in for Revit 2019 from the Autodesk Desktop App or from the Autodesk Account portal.
 
## Step 2: Create a BIM 360 Project
 
To collaborate on Revit models using BIM 360 Design, you need to create a BIM 360 project and invite your team members to join. A BIM 360 project is a cloud-based workspace where you can store and manage your project data, such as models, drawings, documents, and issues.
 
To create a BIM 360 project, follow these steps:
 
1. Log in to your Autodesk Account and go to the BIM 360 page.
2. Click on the Account Admin icon at the top right corner of the page.
3. Select the account where you want to create the project.
4. Click on the Projects tab and then click on Add.
5. Fill in the project details, such as name, type, location, start date, end date, etc.
6. Click on Save & Continue.
7. Select the services that you want to enable for the project. For Revit collaboration, you need to enable Document Management and Design Collaboration.
8. Click on Activate.

Your BIM 360 project is now created and ready for collaboration.
 
## Step 3: Invite Team Members to the Project
 
To collaborate with other Revit users on your BIM 360 project, you need to invite them to join the project and assign them appropriate roles and permissions. To invite team members to the project, follow these steps:
