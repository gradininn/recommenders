If you want to play SpeedRunners multiplayer with your friends, you have two options: local multiplayer or online multiplayer. Here's how to set up both modes:
 
## Local Multiplayer
 
Local multiplayer allows you to play SpeedRunners on the same screen with up to 4 players using controllers or keyboards. You can also mix and match controllers and keyboards if you don't have enough of either. Here are the steps to start a local multiplayer match:
 
1. Open SpeedRunners and go to multiplayer > custom match.
2. Now you should see up to 4 controllers ready to join the match, each one of you now have to press A (or Enter on keyboard) to join a slot.
3. Select a character, then a map and play[^1^].

## Online Multiplayer
 
Online multiplayer allows you to play SpeedRunners with your friends over the internet, or with strangers from around the world. You can also play against computer-controlled bots if you want to practice or fill up empty slots. Here are the steps to start an online multiplayer match:

1. Open SpeedRunners and go to multiplayer > quick match or ranked match.
2. Select a game mode (race, arena, rockets, etc.) and wait for the matchmaking to find you a suitable lobby.
3. If you want to play with your friends only, you can create a private lobby by pressing Y (or Tab on keyboard) and invite them from your Steam friends list.
4. Select a character, then a map and play[^2^].

That's it! You're ready to enjoy SpeedRunners multiplayer with your friends. Have fun and don't forget to check out the 50,000 levels made by players like you[^2^]!

## Tips and Tricks for SpeedRunners
 
SpeedRunners is not only a game of speed, but also of strategy, skill, and timing. To become the best runner, you need to know how to use the various weapons, power-ups, and environmental features to your advantage. Here are some tips and tricks to help you improve your game:

- Use your grappling hook wisely. The grappling hook is one of the most versatile and useful tools in SpeedRunners. You can use it to swing around corners, pull yourself up to higher platforms, or even grab your opponents and throw them off balance. However, you also need to be careful not to overuse it or misuse it. If you grapple too often, you will lose momentum and speed. If you grapple at the wrong angle or direction, you might end up crashing into walls or obstacles. Learn when and where to grapple for optimal results.
- Know your weapons and power-ups. SpeedRunners features a variety of weapons and power-ups that can help you gain an edge over your rivals or hinder their progress. Some examples are rockets, bombs, crates, shockwaves, ice beams, hooks, golden hooks, fireballs, boulders, and drills. Each weapon and power-up has its own pros and cons, and some are more effective in certain situations than others. For instance, rockets are good for long-range attacks, but can be dodged or deflected by obstacles. Bombs are good for close-range attacks, but can also hurt yourself if you're not careful. Crates are good for blocking paths or slowing down opponents, but can also be destroyed by weapons or grapples. Shockwaves are good for knocking back opponents or clearing obstacles, but have a limited range and duration. Ice beams are good for freezing opponents or slippery surfaces, but can also be thawed by fireballs or drills. Hooks are good for pulling opponents closer to you or stealing their power-ups, but can also be countered by hooks or golden hooks. Golden hooks are good for targeting the leader and pulling them back to the pack, but can only be used once per round. Fireballs are good for setting things on fire or melting ice, but can also be extinguished by water or ice beams. Boulders are good for rolling over opponents or crushing obstacles, but can also be stopped by walls or shockwaves. Drills are good for drilling through walls or opponents, but can also overheat if used too long. Experiment with different weapons and power-ups and find out which ones suit your playstyle and strategy.
- Use the environment to your advantage. SpeedRunners features a variety of maps with different themes and layouts. Each map has its own unique features and hazards that can affect your performance and strategy. For example, some maps have spikes that can impale you if you touch them; some maps have lasers that can zap you if you cross them; some maps have fans that can blow you up or down; some maps have water that can slow you down or put out fire; some maps have switches that can activate traps or open shortcuts; some maps have boost pads that can give you a burst of speed; some maps have loops that can make you go upside down; some maps have portals that can teleport you to different locations; and so on. Learn the layout and features of each map and use them to your advantage or avoid them if they're disadvantageous.

With these tips and tricks, you'll be on your way to becoming a faster and better SpeedRunner. Remember to practice regularly, challenge yourself with different modes and difficulties, and have fun!
