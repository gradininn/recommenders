Mixed In Key 7 is based on the concept of harmonic mixing, which is a technique that ensures that the songs you mix together are compatible in terms of key and scale. This way, you can avoid clashing notes and create smooth transitions between tracks. Harmonic mixing can also enhance the mood and energy of your mix, as you can choose songs that match or contrast each other in terms of musical emotion.
 
To use Mixed In Key 7, you simply need to drag and drop your music files into the software, and it will analyze them and assign them a key code and an energy level. The key code is based on the Camelot Wheel, which is a system that simplifies the musical notation and shows the compatible keys in a circular diagram. The energy level is a number from 1 to 10 that indicates how energetic or calm a song is. You can then use these information to sort and filter your songs and create harmonic playlists.
 
Mixed In Key 7 also has other features that can help you improve your mixing skills and creativity. For example, you can edit the cue points of your songs and customize where you want to start or end your mix. You can also use the Mashup feature to create mashups of different songs with the same key or energy level. You can also export your playlists to other DJ software like Serato, Traktor, or Rekordbox, and sync them with your DJ controller or mixer.
