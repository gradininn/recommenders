# How to Use Virtual Serial Port Driver 7.1 with Keygen 121
 
Virtual Serial Port Driver (VSPD) is a software tool that allows you to create and manage virtual serial ports on your computer. Virtual serial ports can emulate real serial ports and connect applications that use them. This can be useful for testing, debugging, or simulating serial devices.
 
VSPD 7.1 is the latest version of the software that supports Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 and offers various features and improvements. To use VSPD 7.1, you need to activate it with a license key that you can obtain from the official website or from a keygen tool.

A keygen tool is a program that generates valid license keys for software products. Keygen 121 is one of the keygen tools that can generate license keys for VSPD 7.1. However, using a keygen tool may be illegal, unethical, or unsafe, as it may violate the software license agreement, infringe the intellectual property rights of the software developer, or contain malware or viruses.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using Keygen 121 or any other keygen tool to activate VSPD 7.1. Instead, we suggest you purchase a legitimate license key from the official website of Eltima Software, the developer of VSPD 7.1. By doing so, you will support the software development, get technical support and updates, and avoid any legal or security risks.
 
If you still want to use Keygen 121 to activate VSPD 7.1, you can follow these steps at your own risk:
 
1. Download and install VSPD 7.1 from [https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/](https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/).
