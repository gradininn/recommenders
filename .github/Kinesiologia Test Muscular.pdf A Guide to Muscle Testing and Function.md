# What is Kinesiology and How Does It Use the Muscle Test?
 
Kinesiology is the study of human movement, but more specifically, the reaction of muscles to stressful situations or that the patient experiences as a strong tension. The muscles usually react by tensing and weakening and the kinesiologist's purpose is to find the root of the stress and restore the body's balance.

The way to detect the problem is through a Kinesiological Muscle Test, with which the physical, chemical, emotional or mental cause of the stress is found. Then the intervention is done through various techniques and therapies such as acupuncture, brain gymnastics, energy exercises and rhythmic movements. In this way, the cause is released and the patient finds the well-being they are looking for.
 
The Kinesiological Muscle Test is a simple and non-invasive method that consists of applying a gentle pressure on a muscle (usually an arm or a leg) and observing its response. If the muscle resists the pressure, it means that it is strong and balanced. If the muscle gives way to the pressure, it means that it is weak and unbalanced.

Kinesiology is not only a therapeutic method, but also a way of understanding ourselves better and discovering our potential. By using the muscle test, we can access our subconscious mind, which stores all our memories, beliefs, emotions and experiences. The subconscious mind is also connected to our intuition, our creativity and our higher self.
 
By communicating with our subconscious mind through the muscle test, we can identify and release the negative patterns that limit us and prevent us from living fully. We can also find and reinforce the positive aspects that empower us and help us achieve our goals. We can also receive guidance and inspiration from our inner wisdom.
 
Kinesiology is a tool for self-knowledge and self-healing that anyone can learn and use. It can help us improve our health, our happiness and our harmony with ourselves and others. It can also help us discover our true purpose and express our unique talents in the world.
