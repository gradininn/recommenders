Cities XL 2012 is a city simulator game developed by Focus Home Interactive and released on October 20, 2011. It is the third game in the Cities XL series, which allows players to build, develop and connect cities of various sizes and types on a virtual planet. In this full oyun review, we will look at the features, gameplay, graphics and performance of Cities XL 2012.
 
## Features
 
Cities XL 2012 offers a huge variety of over 1,000 buildings and structures, including 50 new ones, that players can freely place and customize on their maps. The game also features over 60 different maps with diverse terrains and climates, ranging from tropical islands to snowy mountains. Players can also create their own maps using the map editor tool.

## Gameplay
 
The gameplay of Cities XL 2012 is similar to its predecessors, but with some improvements and additions. Players can choose from four different social classes of residents: unskilled workers, skilled workers, executives and elites. Each class has different needs and preferences that affect their happiness and productivity. Players have to balance the supply and demand of various resources such as water, electricity, food, jobs, leisure and culture. They also have to manage the traffic, pollution, crime and natural disasters that may occur in their cities.
 
One of the main features of Cities XL 2012 is the ability to connect cities with each other through trade or transportation networks. Players can exchange resources or services with other cities, either locally or globally. This adds a layer of complexity and strategy to the game, as players have to consider the benefits and costs of each trade deal or connection. However, this feature is only available in single-player mode, as the multiplayer mode was discontinued in March 2010 due to low subscription rates.
 
## Graphics
 
Cities XL 2012 has improved graphics compared to its previous versions. The game uses a new engine that supports DirectX 11 and enhances the lighting, shadows and reflections effects. The buildings and structures are detailed and realistic, and the maps are diverse and colorful. The game also supports high-resolution textures and anti-aliasing options. However, some players may experience performance issues or bugs when playing on high settings or large maps.
