Camphor Pro was designed by Nick Job in 2004 and released by Linotype in 2010. It is an updated and expanded version of the original Camphor font, which was inspired by the early 20th century sans serif fonts such as Futura and Gill Sans. Camphor Pro has 12 styles, ranging from Thin to Black, with matching italics. It also supports over 40 languages and includes a variety of OpenType features such as ligatures, fractions, alternates, and small caps.
 
One of the advantages of Camphor Pro is its versatility. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as headlines, logos, posters, magazines, websites, apps, and more. It can also be paired with other fonts to create contrast and harmony. For example, you can use Camphor Pro for the body text and a serif font for the headings, or vice versa. You can also mix and match different weights and styles of Camphor Pro to create dynamic and interesting layouts.

1. Choose the appropriate weight and style for your purpose. Camphor Pro has 12 styles, from Thin to Black, with matching italics. You can use the lighter weights for headlines and the heavier weights for subheadings or emphasis. You can also use the italics for quotes or captions.
2. Use proper spacing and alignment. Camphor Pro has a generous x-height and a low contrast between thick and thin strokes. This makes it easy to read and legible at any size. However, you should also pay attention to the spacing and alignment of your text. You can use the kerning and tracking options in your software to adjust the spacing between letters and words. You can also use the alignment options to align your text to the left, right, center, or justify.
3. Pair it with other fonts wisely. Camphor Pro can work well with other fonts, as long as they have a similar style or contrast. For example, you can pair Camphor Pro with a serif font that has a humanist or geometric feel, such as Garamond or Century Gothic. You can also pair Camphor Pro with another sans serif font that has a different weight or width, such as Helvetica or Arial Narrow.

By following these tips and best practices, you can make the most of Camphor Pro and create stunning designs that will impress your audience.
