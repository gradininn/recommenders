The book has 15 chapters and 352 pages. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and properties of complex variables, such as analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations, contour integration, Cauchy's theorem, Taylor and Laurent series, residue theorem, and conformal mapping. The second chapter deals with ordinary differential equations of first and second order, such as linear equations, homogeneous equations, exact equations, integrating factors, variation of parameters, power series solutions, Frobenius method, Bessel and Legendre equations. The third chapter discusses systems of linear differential equations and their solutions using matrix methods. The fourth chapter covers partial differential equations of first and second order, such as wave equation, heat equation, Laplace equation, separation of variables, Fourier series and transform.
 
The fifth chapter introduces the concept of linear vector spaces and their properties, such as linear independence, basis, dimension, inner product, norm, orthogonality, projection, Gram-Schmidt process. The sixth chapter extends the concept of vector spaces to matrices and their operations, such as addition, multiplication, inverse, transpose, trace, determinant, rank. The chapter also discusses eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices and their applications to diagonalization and similarity transformations. The seventh chapter explores the topic of group theory and its applications to physics. The chapter defines groups and their properties, such as order, identity element, inverse element, closure. The chapter also introduces subgroups, cosets, normal subgroups, quotient groups. The chapter then discusses various types of groups and their representations, such as cyclic groups, permutation groups, symmetry groups.
 
The eighth chapter focuses on the Green's function method for solving differential equations with boundary conditions. The chapter explains the concept of Green's function and its properties. The chapter also shows how to construct Green's function for various types of differential operators and boundary conditions. The ninth chapter deals with tensor analysis and its applications to physics. The chapter defines tensors and their properties, such as rank, components, transformation rules. The chapter also introduces various types of tensors and their operations, such as scalar tensors (invariants), vector tensors (covariant and contravariant), metric tensors (inner product), Kronecker delta (identity tensor), Levi-Civita symbol (alternating tensor), Christoffel symbols (connection coefficients). The chapter then discusses the concepts of covariant differentiation, curvature tensor, Riemannian geometry, and general relativity.
 
The book is well-written and comprehensive in its coverage of mathematical physics topics. The book provides clear explanations and derivations of the concepts and formulas. The book also contains many solved examples and problems that illustrate and supplement the material in the text. The book is suitable for students who want to learn mathematical physics at an advanced level and apply it to various physical problems.
