## Study the Online Course
 
The first step to getting your SIR certificate is to study the online course. The course covers topics such as:
 
- Signs of intoxication and how to assess them
- Legal liability and duty of care
- Reducing alcohol over-consumption and impaired driving
- Preventing the sale of alcohol to minors and intoxicated persons
- Dealing with difficult situations and customers
- Creating and enforcing responsible beverage service policies

The online course is interactive and self-paced, so you can learn at your own convenience. You can also download a PDF print version of the course if you prefer to study offline. The course takes about four hours to complete, but you can pause and resume it as needed.
 
## Take Practice Tests
 
After studying the course materials, you should test your knowledge by taking practice tests. Practice tests are a great way to review the key concepts and identify your strengths and weaknesses. You can find some practice tests online, such as [this one](https://testpermit.com/selling-it-right-exam/). You can also use the quizzes at the end of each module in the online course as practice tests.

## Pass the Exam
 
The final step to getting your SIR certificate is to pass the exam. The exam is online and consists of 30 randomly generated multiple-choice questions. You need to score at least 80% (24 out of 30) to pass. You have three attempts per exam purchase. If you don't pass after your third try, you can re-take the exam for $35.
 
To take the exam, you need to register on the [SIR website](https://www.responsibleservicebc.gov.bc.ca/serving-it-right-course) and pay a fee of $35 plus GST. You will need a reliable internet connection, a browser that allows pop-ups, and a valid email address. You will also need to provide your full name, date of birth, address, phone number, and employer information (if applicable).
 
The exam is open-book, meaning you can use any notes or resources you want. However, you should not rely on them too much, as they may slow you down or confuse you. You should also not share your answers or get help from anyone else, as this is considered cheating and may result in your certificate being revoked.
 
You have 30 minutes to complete the exam. If you run out of time, your exam will be submitted automatically with the answers you have selected so far. You will get your results immediately after submitting your exam. If you pass, you can download and print your certificate right away. Your certificate is valid for five years from the issue date.
