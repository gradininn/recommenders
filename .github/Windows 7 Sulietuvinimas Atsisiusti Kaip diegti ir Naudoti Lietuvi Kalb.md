After installing the language pack, you can change the display language by clicking Start, typing Change display language in the search box, and then clicking Change display language.

Click OK and then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
 
If you have a different edition of Windows 7, such as Home Premium or Professional, you cannot use the official language packs. However, you can try an unofficial method called [Vistalizator](http://www.froggie.sk/en/index.html), which allows you to install language packs on any edition of Windows 7[^4^]. However, this method is not legal or guaranteed to work properly, so use it at your own risk.
